## Summary
A app that let user express ideas that they would like to see expanded into a real story. The concept of this app came from me when I think of an idea to a cool story or plot I would just think about how cool it is but I never write it down. Now if you imagine the millions of people with ideas, there is a lot of good stories that we are missing out so this app lets you write those ideas and other users can comment to create stories.
